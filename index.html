                            At its core, The Bluest Eye is a story about the oppression of women. The novel's women not
                            only suffer the horrors of racial oppression, but also the tyranny and violation brought
                            upon them by the men in their lives. The novel depicts several phases of a woman's
                            development into womanhood.

                            her, none of them can contain their burning desire. Though Slade and Dex don’t mind sharing,
                            Gavin’s tragic past has put distance between him and his brothers. Now, they’re hoping that
                            not only will Hannah love them back . . . but maybe mend their fractured family.</p>

                            I’m not the only person to ever do such a thing. I know that. And I’m not an awful person
                            for desiring his touch, his kiss, his everything… but I knew I shouldn’t have indulged.
                            There’s something about knowing it’s wrong that tempts me that much more. The seduction
                            became a game with higher stakes than any before him. In fact, it was only ever him.
                            The thing is, I knew I shouldn’t. Now that the game is over and the pieces have fallen… I
                            know I should have just walked away.
                            There’s no way out of the wreckage.
                            That doesn’t change the fact, that I wanted him more than anything. I still want him more
                            than anything.</p>
