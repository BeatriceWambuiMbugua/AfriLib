                            At its core, The Bluest Eye is a story about the oppression of women. The novel's women not
                            only suffer the horrors of racial oppression, but also the tyranny and violation brought
                            upon them by the men in their lives. The novel depicts several phases of a woman's
                            development into womanhood.

                            for desiring his touch, his kiss, his everything… but I knew I shouldn’t have indulged.
                            There’s something about knowing it’s wrong that tempts me that much more. The seduction
                            became a game with higher stakes than any before him. In fact, it was only ever him.
                            The thing is, I knew I shouldn’t. Now that the game is over and the pieces have fallen… I
                            know I should have just walked away.
                            There’s no way out of the wreckage.
                            That doesn’t change the fact, that I wanted him more than anything. I still want him more

                            journeys out in search of food. At last he comes upon a palm tree with "thrice four hundred"
                            ripe palm fruits. Atop this palm tree, one of the fruits slips from Tortoise's hand.
                            Unwilling to give up even one of these succulent fruits, Tortoise descends. But the fruit

                            prison. Under the apartheid government, Mandela was regarded as a terrorist and jailed on
                            the infamous Robben Island for his role as a leader of the then-outlawed ANC. He later
                            achieved international recognition for his leadership as president in rebuilding the
                            country's once segregated society. The last chapters of the book describe his political
                            ascension, and his belief that the struggle still continued against apartheid in South
                            Africa.</p>
